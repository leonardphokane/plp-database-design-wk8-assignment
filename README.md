# Project Title: An e-commerce system

## In ecommerce:

A Customer entity includes attributes like CustomerID, Name, Email.
A Product includes ProductID, Name, Stock, Price.
An Order links to both User and Product via relationships.

A customer can place orders, with each order linked back to a customer using UserID as a foreign key. 
ER Diagrams simplify database design by showing these relationships clearly and ensuring logical structure before implementation.

## Step 1: Identify Entities
Main entities in an ecommerce system:
â€¢	Customer
â€¢	Product
â€¢	Order
â€¢	OrderItem (junction entity for many-to-many between Orders and Products)
â€¢	Payment
â€¢	Category
â€¢	Shipping

## Step 2: Define Attributes
â€¢	Customer: CustomerID (PK), Name, Email, Phone, Address
â€¢	Product: ProductID (PK), Name, Description, Price, Stock, CategoryID (FK)
â€¢	Order: OrderID (PK), OrderDate, Status, CustomerID (FK)
â€¢	OrderItem: OrderItemID (PK), OrderID (FK), ProductID (FK), Quantity, Subtotal
â€¢	Payment: PaymentID (PK), PaymentDate, Amount, OrderID (FK), PaymentMethod
â€¢	Category: CategoryID (PK), CategoryName
â€¢	Shipping: ShippingID (PK), OrderID (FK), ShipDate, Carrier, TrackingNumber


## Step 3: Establish Relationships
â€¢	A Customer places many Orders (one-to-many)
â€¢	An Order contains many OrderItems (one-to-many)
â€¢	A Product belongs to a Category (many-to-one)
â€¢	A Product appears in many OrderItems (many-to-many via OrderItem)
â€¢	An Order has one Payment
â€¢	An Order has one Shipping

## Key Concepts of ER Diagrams
To build an effective ER Diagram, you need to understand its fundamental components:

**Entities**: These represent real-world objects. In ecommerce, typical entities include Customer, Product, and Order.
**Attributes**: These describe properties of an entity. For example, a Product might have ProductID, Name, and Price.
**Relationships**: These show how entities are connected. A Customer places an Order.
**Primary Keys (PK)**: Unique identifiers for each entity.
**Foreign Keys (FK)**: Attributes that link to primary keys in other tables to establish relationships.

Used **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling** to design the schema. Here's an example for an **e-commerce system**:

Tables:

## Users

id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
name (VARCHAR)
email (VARCHAR, UNIQUE)
password (VARCHAR)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)

## Products

id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
name (VARCHAR)
description (TEXT)
price (DECIMAL)
stock (INT)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)

## Orders

id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users.id)
total_price (DECIMAL)
status (ENUM: 'pending', 'completed', 'cancelled')
created_at (TIMESTAMP)

## Order_Items

id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
order_id (Foreign Key referencing Orders.id)
product_id (Foreign Key referencing Products.id)
quantity (INT)
price (DECIMAL)

That's what the project does

How to run/setup the project (or import SQL)



ðŸ§  For Question 1:

Only one .sql file (well-commented)

ðŸ’» For Question 2:

Source code files (organized properly)

SQL script used to create your database
