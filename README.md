# Project Title
# Ecommerce Database System

## In ecommerce:

A Customer entity includes attributes like CustomerID, Name, Email.
A Product includes ProductID, Name, Stock, Price.
An Order links to both User and Product via relationships.

A customer can place orders, with each order linked back to a customer using UserID as a foreign key. 
ER Diagrams simplify database design by showing these relationships clearly and ensuring logical structure before implementation.

## Step 1: Identify Entities
Main entities in an ecommerce system:
-	Customer
-	Product
-	Order
-	OrderItem (junction entity for many-to-many between Orders and Products)
-	Payment
-	Category
-	Shipping

## Step 2: Define Attributes
-	Customer: CustomerID (PK), Name, Email, Phone, Address
-	Product: ProductID (PK), Name, Description, Price, Stock, CategoryID (FK)
-	Order: OrderID (PK), OrderDate, Status, CustomerID (FK)
-	OrderItem: OrderItemID (PK), OrderID (FK), ProductID (FK), Quantity, Subtotal
-	Payment: PaymentID (PK), PaymentDate, Amount, OrderID (FK), PaymentMethod
-	Category: CategoryID (PK), CategoryName
-	Shipping: ShippingID (PK), OrderID (FK), ShipDate, Carrier, TrackingNumber


## Step 3: Establish Relationships
-	A Customer places many Orders (one-to-many)
-	An Order contains many OrderItems (one-to-many)
-	A Product belongs to a Category (many-to-one)
-	A Product appears in many OrderItems (many-to-many via OrderItem)
-	An Order has one Payment
-	An Order has one Shipping

## Key Concepts of ER Diagrams
To build an effective ER Diagram, you need to understand its fundamental components:

**Entities**: These represent real-world objects. In ecommerce, typical entities include Customer, Product, and Order.
**Attributes**: These describe properties of an entity. For example, a Product might have ProductID, Name, and Price.
**Relationships**: These show how entities are connected. A Customer places an Order.
**Primary Keys (PK)**: Unique identifiers for each entity.
**Foreign Keys (FK)**: Attributes that link to primary keys in other tables to establish relationships.
