# Project Title
## An e-commerce system:

## In ecommerce:

A Customer entity includes attributes like CustomerID, Name, Email.
A Product includes ProductID, Name, Stock, Price.
An Order links to both User and Product via relationships.

A customer can place orders, with each order linked back to a customer using UserID as a foreign key. 
ER Diagrams simplify database design by showing these relationships clearly and ensuring logical structure before implementation.

## Main entities in an ecommerce system:

Customer
Product
Order
OrderItem (junction entity for many-to-many between Orders and Products)


## Key Concepts of ER Diagrams
To build an effective ER Diagram, you need to understand its fundamental components:

**Entities**: These represent real-world objects. In ecommerce, typical entities include Customer, Product, and Order.
**Attributes**: These describe properties of an entity. For example, a Product might have ProductID, Name, and Price.
**Relationships**: These show how entities are connected. A Customer places an Order.
**Primary Keys (PK)**: Unique identifiers for each entity.
**Foreign Keys (FK)**: Attributes that link to primary keys in other tables to establish relationships.

Used **Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling** to design the schema. Here's an example for an **e-commerce system**:

Tables:

## Users

id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
name (VARCHAR)
email (VARCHAR, UNIQUE)
password (VARCHAR)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)

## Products

id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
name (VARCHAR)
description (TEXT)
price (DECIMAL)
stock (INT)
created_at (TIMESTAMP)

## Orders

id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
user_id (Foreign Key referencing Users.id)
total_price (DECIMAL)
status (ENUM: 'pending', 'completed', 'cancelled')
created_at (TIMESTAMP)

## Order_Items

id (Primary Key, Auto Increment)
order_id (Foreign Key referencing Orders.id)
product_id (Foreign Key referencing Products.id)
quantity (INT)
price (DECIMAL)
